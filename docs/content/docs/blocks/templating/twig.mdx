# Twig

Twig is a flexible, fast, and secure template engine for PHP. It allows developers to write concise and readable code in templates, enhancing productivity and maintainability. Twig supports a variety of features designed to make templating both powerful and straightforward, making it ideal for projects that require robust, reusable templates.

## Setup

To use Twig templates with Blockstudio, you need to install the `timber/timber` package (which includes Twig) using Composer. Blockstudio will automatically detect if Timber is installed and enable Twig templating for your blocks.

```bash title="Terminal"
composer require timber/timber
```

Once Timber is installed, Blockstudio will automatically handle the rendering of `index.twig` files found within your block folders.

## Template Variables

All Twig files will have access to the Timber context, which includes common WordPress data and functions, as well as Blockstudio-specific variables:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `a` | An alias for `attributes` |
| `attributes` | The block's attributes |
| `b` | An alias for `block` |
| `block` | Data related to the block itself (includes `postId`, `postType`, `context`, etc.) |
| `c` | An alias for `context` |
| `context` | The block's context (e.g., `postId`, `postType` when in a loop) |
| `isEditor` | Boolean, true if the block is rendering in the editor |
| `isPreview` | Boolean, true if the block is rendering in the inserter preview |

## Usage

To use Twig for your block's template, simply create an `index.twig` file in your block's directory. Blockstudio will then automatically use this file for rendering the block.

```twig title="index.twig"
<div class="my-block">
  {% if a.title %}
    <h2>{{ a.title }}</h2>
  {% endif %}

  {% if a.content %}
    <p>{{ a.content }}</p>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```
