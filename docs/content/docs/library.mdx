# Library

Since version 3.1.0, Blockstudio includes a library of prebuilt elements. Of course, these elements are making use of all the features that are available to Blockstudio users. In fact, the library is actively being used to [dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) our own product, helping us fast-track development and ensure a good developer experience for everyone.

The library is a first step in making Blockstudio more available as a general collection of ready-to-use blocks for non developers, all the while being built with the most advanced block framework for WordPress. More blocks are actively being developed!

## Activating

To activate the library on your site, use the following `library` setting:

```php title="functions.php"
add_filter('blockstudio/settings', function($settings) {
  $settings['library'] = true;
  return $settings;
});
```

Or via `blockstudio.json`:

```json title="blockstudio.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://app.blockstudio.dev/schema/blockstudio",
  "library": true
}
```

## Available Blocks

The library includes a variety of prebuilt blocks that you can use immediately in your projects. These blocks are continually being expanded and improved.
