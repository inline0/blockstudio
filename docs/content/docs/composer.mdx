# Composer

Blockstudio is available as a Composer package. This is the recommended way to install it in managed WordPress projects.

## Installation

```bash
composer require blockstudio/blockstudio
```

The package is published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/blockstudio/blockstudio).

## Embedding in Plugins and Themes

Blockstudio is fully namespaced and uses a singleton pattern, so it can be safely embedded within other plugins or themes without class name collisions. If you are building a plugin or theme that bundles Blockstudio, require it in your project's `composer.json`:

```json title="composer.json"
{
  "name": "my-company/my-plugin",
  "require": {
    "blockstudio/blockstudio": "^7.0"
  }
}
```

The singleton pattern ensures only one instance runs, even if multiple plugins bundle Blockstudio. Namespacing prevents conflicts with other libraries in the WordPress environment.
