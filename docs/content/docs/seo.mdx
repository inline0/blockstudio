description: How Blockstudio integrates with SEO plugins for real-time content analysis.
---

# SEO

Blockstudio blocks are dynamic. The `save` function stores attribute data but no visible text in `post_content`. This means SEO plugins that analyze editor content won't see text from Blockstudio fields by default.

Blockstudio automatically detects supported SEO plugins and injects field content into their analysis pipeline. No configuration is needed.

<Callout type="info">
  Frontend SEO is unaffected. Dynamic blocks render via `render_callback`, so search engine crawlers and server-side meta generation always see the full content.
</Callout>

## Supported Plugins

### Yoast SEO

Blockstudio registers as a Yoast plugin and uses the `registerModification` API to append field content to the analyzed text. Changes are detected via `wp.data.subscribe` with a 1-second debounce, and Yoast's analysis refreshes automatically when content changes.

### Rank Math

Blockstudio hooks into the `rank_math_content` filter via `wp.hooks.addFilter` to append field content. Content updates follow the same debounced change detection as Yoast.

### SEOPress

SEOPress performs content analysis by rendering the actual frontend page via `wp_remote_get`. Since Blockstudio blocks render server-side through `render_callback`, SEOPress sees the full rendered output automatically. No integration code is needed.

## Other Plugins

**All in One SEO (AIOSEO)** runs its analysis in a Web Worker with no public API for third-party content injection.

**The SEO Framework** and **Slim SEO** focus on meta tag management and do not perform content analysis scoring.

## Analyzed Content

The integration extracts text from the following field types:

| Field Type | Extraction |
|---|---|
| `text` | Plain text value |
| `textarea` | Plain text value |
| `richtext` | HTML stripped to plain text |
| `wysiwyg` | HTML stripped to plain text |
| `link` | The `title` property |
| `repeater` | Recursively extracts from nested fields |

All other field types (number, color, toggle, files, etc.) are excluded from analysis.

## Disabled Fields

Fields listed in the block's `disabled` array are excluded from SEO analysis, matching frontend rendering behavior. When a field is [disabled](/docs/attributes/disabling), it is neither rendered on the frontend nor included in the SEO content.
