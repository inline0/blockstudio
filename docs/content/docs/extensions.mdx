# Extensions

Extensions allow you to extend any registered block in your WordPress installation using a simple `.json` based API, which is similar to the `block.json` configuration. This includes core, third-party and blocks made with Blockstudio.

All [field types](/docs/attributes/field-types) can be added to any block, with the data being saved to the block's attributes. The complete feature set of attributes like [filtering](/docs/attributes/filtering), [disabling](/docs/attributes/disabling), [conditional logic](/docs/attributes/conditional-logic) and [populating options](/docs/attributes/populating-options) are available for extensions.

## Extension Types

Extended values can be utilized in versatile ways:

- **class**: Add a class using the attribute value to the block
- **style**: Add inline styles using the attribute value to the block
- **attributes**: Set any attribute value directly on the block
- **data attributes**: Use extension values to set specific data attributes

## Setup

Imagine the following scenario: you want to add a custom class `select` field to every core block. All you need to do is add this `.json` file anywhere in your block folder, and it will be automatically registered as an extension.

```json title="core.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://app.blockstudio.dev/schema/extend",
  "name": "core/*",
  "priority": 10,
  "blockstudio": {
    "extend": true,
    "attributes": [
      {
        "id": "customColor",
        "type": "select",
        "label": "Custom color",
        "options": [
          {
            "value": "#f00",
            "label": "Red"
          },
          {
            "value": "#00f",
            "label": "Blue"
          }
        ],
        "set": [
          {
            "attribute": "style",
            "value": "color: {attributes.customColor}"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

This will add a `customColor` field to every core block, allowing you to set the color of the block's text.

### File Name

Since there is no rendering template, an extension doesn't need a matching `index` file and thus doesn't need to be named `block.json`. This allows storing all extensions conveniently in a single folder.

### Schema

Blockstudio provides a custom JSON schema for extension configurations:

[View Extension schema](https://app.blockstudio.dev/schema/extend)

### Name

The `name` property of the configuration object defines which blocks should be extended. There are three options depending on your needs:

- **blockName**: A single block name, e.g. `core/paragraph`
- **[blockNameA, blockNameB]**: An array of block names, e.g. `["core/paragraph", "core/heading"]`
- **core/\***: A wildcard to extend all blocks of a certain type

### Blockstudio Key

Just like when using `block.json` for custom blocks, the `blockstudio` property has to be present in the configuration object with `extend` set to `true`.

### Position

By default, extensions will render in its own tab in the block inspector. If you want to move the extensions to a different position, you can use the `group` property:

- **settings**: The default position
- **styles**: The styles tab
- **advanced**: The advanced tab

```json title="core.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://app.blockstudio.dev/schema/extend",
  "name": "core/*",
  "blockstudio": {
    "extend": true,
    "group": "styles",
    "attributes": []
  }
}
```

### Priority

The `priority` property allows you to define the order in which extensions are rendered. Extensions with a higher priority will be rendered later.

## Attributes

For more information on how attributes work, please refer to the [attributes section](/docs/attributes/field-types).

The only thing you need to know about attributes inside extensions is the `set` property. It is used to apply the value of the attribute to one of the [extension types](#extension-types).

```json title="core.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://app.blockstudio.dev/schema/extend",
  "name": "core/*",
  "blockstudio": {
    "extend": true,
    "attributes": [
      {
        "id": "customColor",
        "type": "select",
        "label": "Heading color",
        "options": [
          {
            "value": "#f00",
            "label": "Red"
          },
          {
            "value": "#00f",
            "label": "Blue"
          }
        ],
        "set": [
          {
            "attribute": "style",
            "value": "color: {attributes.customColor}"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Getting Values

Dot notation inside curly braces is used to get the value of an attribute.

It is also possible to get nested values when attributes are not returning a single value, for example, when setting the return format to `both` on field types with options.

```json
{
  "attributes": [
    {
      "id": "customColor",
      "type": "select",
      "label": "Heading color",
      "options": [
        {
          "value": "#f00",
          "label": "Red"
        },
        {
          "value": "#00f",
          "label": "Blue"
        }
      ],
      "returnFormat": "both",
      "set": [
        {
          "attribute": "style",
          "value": "color: {attributes.customColor.value}"
        },
        {
          "attribute": "data-color",
          "value": "{attributes.customColor.label}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The example above will set the `style` attribute to `color: #f00` or `color: #00f` and the `data-color` attribute to `Red` or `Blue` depending on the value.

For now, only values from the current attribute can be used inside `set` definitions. The ability to use values from other attributes might be added in the future.

### Arrays

When using arrays, the `set` property will be applied to every item in the array.

### Attributes Field

When using the `attributes` field, there is no `set` property needed, as the field automatically maps the values to the attribute name and value.
