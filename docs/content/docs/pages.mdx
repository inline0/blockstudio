# Pages

Pages are file-based templates that sync to the WordPress database as posts. When you update a template file, Blockstudio detects the change and updates the corresponding page.

## page.json

Each page folder needs a `page.json` configuration file:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "about",
  "title": "About Us",
  "slug": "about-us",
  "postType": "page",
  "postStatus": "publish",
  "templateLock": "all"
}
```

### Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | *required* | Unique identifier for the page |
| `title` | `string` | Auto from name | The page title |
| `slug` | `string` | Same as name | URL slug for the page |
| `postType` | `string` | `"page"` | WordPress post type |
| `postStatus` | `string` | `"draft"` | Status for new posts (`publish`, `draft`, `pending`, `private`) |
| `postId` | `integer` | — | Pin the page to a specific WordPress post ID |
| `blockEditingMode` | `string` | — | Block editing mode: `"default"`, `"contentOnly"`, or `"disabled"` |
| `templateLock` | `string\|false` | `"all"` | Lock mode: `"all"`, `"insert"`, `"contentOnly"`, or `false` |
| `templateFor` | `string\|null` | `null` | Set as default template for a post type |
| `sync` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether to sync content when template changes |

## Block Editing Mode

The `blockEditingMode` property controls how blocks can be edited in the editor. Set a page-level default in `page.json` and override per-element in the template:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "about",
  "title": "About Us",
  "templateLock": "all",
  "blockEditingMode": "disabled"
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<h1 blockEditingMode="contentOnly">Editable Title</h1>
<p>This paragraph inherits "disabled" from the page default.</p>
<block name="core/buttons" blockEditingMode="default">
  <block name="core/button" url="/contact">Fully editable button</block>
</block>
```

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"default"` | Full editing — blocks can be selected, moved, and edited |
| `"contentOnly"` | Text editing only — block text is editable but settings and structure are locked |
| `"disabled"` | No editing — blocks are completely non-interactive |

Per-element overrides are set as HTML attributes on any element (`<h1>`, `<p>`, `<div>`, etc.) or on `<block>` elements. Ancestor container blocks of overridden elements are automatically set to `contentOnly` so their children remain accessible.

## Template Lock

The `templateLock` property controls how users can edit the page in the editor:

| Value | Add/Remove | Move | Edit Content |
|-------|------------|------|--------------|
| `"all"` | No | No | No |
| `"insert"` | No | Yes | Yes |
| `"contentOnly"` | No | No | Yes |
| `false` | Yes | Yes | Yes |

When a `templateLock` is set, Blockstudio disables the ability to unlock blocks via the editor UI.

## Sync Behavior

Pages are synced when you visit the WordPress admin. The sync checks the file's modification time and only updates if the file has changed since the last sync.

To prevent a page from being overwritten after manual edits, set `"sync": false` in `page.json`.

## Post ID Pinning

By default, WordPress auto-assigns post IDs. If a page is deleted and re-created, the ID changes, breaking external references like menus or hardcoded links.

Use `postId` to pin a page to a specific ID:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "about",
  "title": "About Us",
  "postId": 42
}
```

When creating the page, Blockstudio passes the ID to WordPress via `import_id`. If the ID is available, WordPress uses it exactly. If the ID is already taken by an unrelated post, WordPress silently auto-assigns a new ID.

When looking up existing pages, Blockstudio checks the pinned ID first — before checking meta or slug. This means if a page is deleted and re-synced, it reclaims the same ID.

## Keyed Block Merging

By default, when a template file changes, Blockstudio replaces the entire post content with the new template. This means any edits made in the WordPress editor are lost.

Add a `key` attribute to blocks to preserve user edits across template syncs. When a template has keyed blocks, Blockstudio merges template changes with the existing post content instead of replacing it.

### Adding Keys

Use the `key` attribute on any HTML element or `<block>` element:

```html title="index.php"
<h1 key="title">Default Title</h1>
<p key="intro">Default intro text.</p>

<div key="features">
  <p>First feature.</p>
  <p>Second feature.</p>
</div>

<block name="core/cover" key="hero" url="https://example.com/bg.jpg">
  <h2>Hero Title</h2>
  <p>Hero description.</p>
</block>
```

Keys must be globally unique across the entire template. A key protects the entire block and all of its content — you don't need to key individual children inside a keyed parent. Keyed blocks can be moved to any position or nesting level between template updates and their user content will still be preserved.

### How Merging Works

When a template file changes and the page re-syncs:

| Block | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| **Keyed block** | User's content is preserved (innerHTML, innerContent, innerBlocks). Template's attributes are applied. |
| **Unkeyed block** | Replaced entirely with the template version (same as without keys) |

### Examples

**User edits are preserved in keyed blocks:**

1. Template defines `<p key="intro">Default intro.</p>`
2. User edits the paragraph in the editor to "Custom intro text."
3. Developer updates the template — adds a new block, changes layout
4. On sync: the paragraph keeps "Custom intro text." while the new layout is applied

**Attributes from the template still apply:**

1. Template has a cover block with `key="hero"` and a `url` attribute
2. Developer changes the cover's `url` attribute to a new background image
3. On sync: the new background image is applied, but user's content edits inside the cover are preserved

### Edge Cases

| Scenario | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| New keyed block added to template | Appears with the template's default content |
| Keyed block removed from template | Deleted from the post |
| Block type changes (same key) | Template wins entirely — no content merge |
| Duplicate keys | Second occurrence is treated as unkeyed |
| No keys in template | Full replacement (same behavior as without keys) |
| Force sync | Full replacement — keys are ignored |
| Locked post | No sync at all |

### Combining with Editing Controls

Keys, `templateLock`, and `blockEditingMode` combine to give you fine-grained control over what clients can and can't do. Here are common workflow patterns.

#### Fully locked page

The developer controls everything. The page is a static layout that clients can't touch at all. Useful for legal pages, terms of service, or any page that should only change through code.

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "terms",
  "title": "Terms of Service",
  "templateLock": "all"
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 2025</p>
<p>These terms govern your use of our service...</p>
```

No keys needed — the template is the single source of truth. Every sync overwrites the page entirely.

#### Locked layout with editable content

The most common pattern. Lock the page structure so clients can't add, remove, or rearrange blocks, but let them edit text in specific places. Keys ensure their edits survive template updates.

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "landing",
  "title": "Landing Page",
  "templateLock": "all",
  "blockEditingMode": "disabled"
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<block name="core/cover" key="hero" url="https://example.com/bg.jpg">
  <h1 blockEditingMode="contentOnly">Edit This Title</h1>
  <p blockEditingMode="contentOnly">Edit this description.</p>
</block>

<div key="features">
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <p blockEditingMode="contentOnly">Editable feature intro.</p>
</div>

<block name="core/buttons">
  <block name="core/button" url="/contact">Contact Us</block>
</block>
```

The client can edit the hero title, description, and feature intro — nothing else. The button text, URL, and cover background image are developer-controlled. When the developer updates the template (e.g., adds a second button), keyed sections keep the client's text.

#### Evolving template with preserved content

For pages that grow over time. The developer adds new sections to the template, and each sync adds the new content without touching what the client has already customized.

```html title="index.php (initial)"
<h1 key="title">Welcome</h1>
<p key="intro">Our introduction.</p>
<div key="services">
  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>We offer great things.</p>
</div>
```

```html title="index.php (updated later)"
<h1 key="title">Welcome</h1>
<p key="intro">Our introduction.</p>
<div key="services">
  <h2>Our Services</h2>
  <p>We offer great things.</p>
</div>
<div key="testimonials">
  <h2>Testimonials</h2>
  <p>What our clients say.</p>
</div>
<block name="core/buttons">
  <block name="core/button" url="/contact">Get in Touch</block>
</block>
```

The new testimonials section and button appear on sync. The client's edits to the title, intro, and services are untouched.

#### One-time scaffold

Create a page with a starting structure, then hand it off entirely. Set `sync` to `false` so the template is only used for the initial creation — after that, the client owns the page completely.

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "blog",
  "title": "Blog",
  "sync": false
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<h1>Our Blog</h1>
<p>Welcome to our blog. Start writing!</p>
```

The page is created once. After that, the client can add, remove, and rearrange blocks freely. Template changes are ignored.

## Post Type Templates

Use `templateFor` to set a page as the default template for a post type:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "product-template",
  "title": "Product Template",
  "templateFor": "product",
  "templateLock": "insert"
}
```

Any new posts of that type will start with the defined block structure.

## Custom Paths

By default, Blockstudio scans `get_template_directory() . '/pages'`. Add additional paths with the filter:

```php
add_filter( 'blockstudio/pages/paths', function( $paths ) {
    $paths[] = get_stylesheet_directory() . '/custom-pages';
    $paths[] = MY_PLUGIN_DIR . '/pages';
    return $paths;
} );
```

## PHP API

```php
// Get all registered pages
$pages = Blockstudio\Pages::pages();

// Get a specific page
$page = Blockstudio\Pages::get_page('about');

// Get the WordPress post ID for a page
$postId = Blockstudio\Pages::get_post_id('about');

// Force sync a page (ignores modification time)
Blockstudio\Pages::force_sync('about');

// Force sync all pages
Blockstudio\Pages::force_sync_all();

// Lock a page to prevent automatic updates
Blockstudio\Pages::lock('about');

// Unlock a page
Blockstudio\Pages::unlock('about');
```
