# Gutenberg Integration

Since 5.2, it is possible to edit blocks directly from Gutenberg. By clicking the "Edit with Blockstudio" button in the sidebar, the editor will open in a separate window and allow you to make changes to the block itself or its assets and preview them inside Gutenberg.

Editing blocks using this method has one advantage over the built-in editor preview that Blockstudio provides: the same block inserted multiple times with different settings can be previewed at once.

The [editor needs to be active](/docs/editor/general#setup) in order for the preview button to show up.

## Limitations

At the moment, any changes made to the `block.json` file will not be reflected inside Gutenberg. This functionality will be added in a future update.
