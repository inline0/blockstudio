# Components

Blockstudio provides template components that map to native WordPress editor features. In the editor, they become interactive React components. On the frontend, they render as plain HTML.

- [useBlockProps](/docs/components/useblockprops):Mark the block wrapper element
- [InnerBlocks](/docs/components/innerblocks):Allow nested blocks within your block
- [RichText](/docs/components/richtext):Inline rich text editing
- [MediaPlaceholder](/docs/components/mediaplaceholder):Media upload and selection
