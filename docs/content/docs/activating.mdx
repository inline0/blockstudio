# Activating

Blockstudio can be activated on a site by navigating to the `Blockstudio` menu item in the WordPress admin dashboard.

Alternatively, it is also possible to activate Blockstudio using PHP. This is done by adding the following constant to your `functions.php` file:

```php title="functions.php"
const BLOCKSTUDIO_LICENSE = "YOUR LICENSE KEY";
```

Replace `YOUR LICENSE KEY` with your actual Blockstudio license key.
