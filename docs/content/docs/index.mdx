# Introduction

Blockstudio enables you to create custom WordPress blocks with nothing but PHP
using the WordPress
[block.json](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/)
format. It greatly simplifies the developer experience in regard to block
registration, lazy loading assets, and custom fields.

## Philosophy

### Core focused

There is no secret sauce. Blockstudio is built on top of core WordPress features
and Gutenberg components. It is designed to be a lightweight abstraction layer
that helps you get started with custom blocks quickly.

### Server side first

When creating dynamic blocks using nothing but WordPress, there is duplication
of logic between PHP and JS code. [There are
discussions](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/discussions/38224) about
solving this issue, including hydrating blocks on the client side (not good for
SEO) or introducing a JSX parser for PHP (complex).

Blockstudio takes a different approach. You use PHP to write your block
templates and sprinkle in interactivity like `<RichText />` or `<InnerBlocks />`
using JSX-like tags. Inside the editor, those tags will be replaced with their
React counterparts. On the frontend, the tags will be replaced with HTML
content.

This way, you get the best of both worlds: a server-side rendered block with
great interactivity in the editor.

### File system based

While WordPress supports a file-based approach using the
[WPDefinedPath](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-metadata/#wpdefinedpath)
string type, it is also possible to link assets or templates from other
destinations. Blockstudio doubles down on the file-system as the primary (and
only) way of registering blocks. This decision was not made to restrict, but to
set a block structure in place that can't be argued with. For example, if a
`style.css` or `script.js` file is found in the same folder as a block.json,
then you can be sure that it belongs to this exact block only.

### No setup

Blockstudio just works. It is designed to remove friction when composing custom
blocks and doesn't come in your way while doing so. Want to use Twig for your
template? Simply rename the file extension. Need to include some CSS? Create a
`style.css` file. Blockstudio will automatically enqueue it whenever the block
is being used on your page, even when it is used outside the post_content with
the [rendering function](/docs/rendering).
