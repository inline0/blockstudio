# Assets

Blockstudio provides a zero-config asset pipeline for your blocks. Drop CSS, SCSS, or JavaScript files next to your block and they get compiled, minified, and enqueued automatically.

- [Processing](/docs/assets/processing):SCSS compilation, ES module imports, and minification
- [Code Field](/docs/assets/code-field):Inline code editing via the code field type
