# Migrating to v7

This guide covers the changes you need to make when upgrading from Blockstudio 6 to 7.

## ES Module Imports

### New `npm:` Prefix (Recommended)

Blockstudio 7 introduces a new `npm:` prefix for ES module imports, aligning with [Deno's npm specifier](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/node/#using-npm-packages) convention.

**Before (v6):**

```javascript
import { h, render } from "blockstudio/preact@10.15.1";
import htm from "blockstudio/htm@3.1.1";
import confetti from "blockstudio/canvas-confetti@1.6.0";
```

**After (v7):**

```javascript
import { h, render } from "npm:preact@10.15.1";
import htm from "npm:htm@3.1.1";
import confetti from "npm:canvas-confetti@1.6.0";
```

### CSS Imports

The same change applies to CSS imports:

**Before (v6):**

```javascript
import "blockstudio/swiper@11.0.0/swiper.min.css";
```

**After (v7):**

```javascript
import "npm:swiper@11.0.0/swiper.min.css";
```

### Backward Compatibility

The `blockstudio/` prefix is still supported for backward compatibility. Your existing code will continue to work without changes. However, we recommend migrating to the `npm:` prefix for consistency with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.

The `npm:` prefix offers several advantages:

- **Ecosystem alignment** - Matches Deno's established convention
- **Clarity** - Makes it immediately clear you're importing from npm
- **Future-proofing** - The `blockstudio/` prefix may be deprecated in a future major version
