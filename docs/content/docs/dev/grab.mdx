# Element Grabber

When working with AI coding assistants, you often need to tell them which template file renders a specific element on the page. The element grabber provides a crosshair-style element selector that copies rich element context to your clipboard with a single gesture.

## Activation

The element grabber is gated behind a query parameter. Append `?blockstudio-devtools` to any frontend URL to enable it:

```
https://example.com/?blockstudio-devtools
https://example.com/?p=123&blockstudio-devtools
```

Without the query parameter, no script or data attributes are loaded.

## Settings

Enable the element grabber in your theme's `blockstudio.json`:

```json title="blockstudio.json"
{
  "dev": {
    "grab": {
      "enabled": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable the element grabber. |

The setting is also available as a filter:

```php
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/dev/grab/enabled', '__return_true');
```

## Usage

1. Visit any frontend page with `?blockstudio-devtools` while logged in as a user with `edit_posts` capability.
2. Hold **Cmd+C** (Mac) or **Ctrl+C** (Windows) for 100ms to activate the grabber.
3. A crosshair selector activates with a canvas overlay highlighting Blockstudio blocks as you hover.
4. Two labels appear: one showing the block's template file path and one showing the HTML element tag name.
5. Click an element to copy its context to your clipboard.
6. Paste the result into your AI coding tool.

Press **Escape** or **Cmd+C** again to deactivate without copying. If you release Cmd+C before 100ms, normal copy behavior is preserved.

## Clipboard Format

Clicking an element copies a rich context string designed for AI coding assistants:

```
@<div>

<div class="my-block">
  Hello world
</div>
  in theme-name/blockstudio/blocks/my-block/index.php
```

This includes the element tag name, an HTML preview with attributes and content, and the template file path.

## Internals

Blockstudio adds a `data-blockstudio-path` attribute to every block wrapper element that uses `useBlockProps` on the frontend. This attribute contains the absolute path to the template file that renders the block.

A lightweight vanilla TypeScript module (no React, no WordPress dependencies) is enqueued on the frontend for logged-in editors. It uses `document.elementsFromPoint()` to detect both the specific HTML element under the cursor and its parent Blockstudio block, drawing separate highlights for each.

## Security

The `data-blockstudio-path` attribute and grabber script are only rendered when all conditions are met:

- The `?blockstudio-devtools` query parameter is present.
- The `dev.grab.enabled` setting is `true`.
- The current user has the `edit_posts` capability.

Public visitors never see file paths or the grabber script.
