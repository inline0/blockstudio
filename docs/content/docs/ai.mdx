# AI Integration

Blockstudio ships a pre-built context file designed for LLM coding assistants. The file contains the complete v7 documentation and all JSON schemas in a single `blockstudio-llm.txt` that any AI tool can consume.

## What's included

The context file combines two sources into roughly 48k tokens:

- **Documentation**: every page from the v7 docs, stripped of formatting and navigation, with code examples preserved.
- **JSON schemas**: the block, settings, page, and extension schemas. Repeated definitions (like field types shared between blocks and extensions) are deduplicated to save tokens.

## How it's built

The file is assembled at build time by `npm run build:llm`, which runs `scripts/build-llm.ts`. The script:

1. Walks the docs directory tree using each folder's `meta.json` to determine page order.
2. Strips MDX frontmatter, JSX components, link URLs, and bold/italic markers from each page.
3. Reads the JSON schemas from `includes/schemas/`, trims the block schema to only the `blockstudio` key, and deduplicates field type definitions shared between the block and extension schemas.
4. Writes the combined output to `includes/llm/blockstudio-llm.txt`.

## How to use it

1. Enable the `ai/enableContextGeneration` setting in your `blockstudio.json`:

```json title="blockstudio.json"
{
  "ai": {
    "enableContextGeneration": true
  }
}
```

2. The context file is now available at `your-site.com/blockstudio-llm.txt`.

3. Point your AI tool to that URL:
   - **Cursor**: add the URL as a doc in your project settings.
   - **Claude Code**: reference the URL or download the file and add it to your project context.
   - **GitHub Copilot**: include the file in your repository or reference it in your instructions.

Any tool that accepts a URL or text file as context will work. The file is static and does not include site-specific data like your registered blocks or current settings.
