# Canvas

The canvas provides a zoomed-out, Figma-like overview of all Blockstudio-managed pages. Each page renders as a live iframe artboard in a single horizontal row. Pan with your trackpad, zoom with pinch or Ctrl+scroll, and press Escape to exit.

## Activation

Append `?blockstudio-canvas` to any frontend URL to enter the canvas:

```
https://example.com/?blockstudio-canvas
https://example.com/my-page/?blockstudio-canvas
```

Without the query parameter, no canvas script is loaded.

## Settings

Enable the canvas and configure its behavior in your theme's `blockstudio.json`:

```json title="blockstudio.json"
{
  "tooling": {
    "canvas": {
      "enabled": true,
      "adminBar": false
    }
  }
}
```

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable the canvas feature. |
| `adminBar` | `boolean` | `true` | Show the WordPress admin bar inside artboard iframes. Set to `false` for a cleaner preview. |

Both settings are also available as filters:

```php
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/tooling/canvas/enabled', '__return_true');
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/tooling/canvas/admin_bar', '__return_false');
```

## Controls

| Action | Input |
|--------|-------|
| Pan | Scroll / trackpad two-finger drag |
| Zoom | Ctrl+scroll or pinch |
| Exit | Escape |

## Security

The canvas script and page data are only loaded when all conditions are met:

- The `?blockstudio-canvas` query parameter is present.
- The `tooling.canvas.enabled` setting is `true`.
- The current user has the `edit_posts` capability.

Public visitors never see the canvas script or page metadata.
