Blockstudio 7 is here. This is the biggest release in the history of the
project: a complete, ground-up rewrite of the entire codebase. Every class,
every hook, every line of code has been rebuilt from scratch with a focus on
modern PHP, WordPress coding standards, and long-term maintainability.

But this isn't just a refactor. Blockstudio 7 introduces major new features
like file-based pages and patterns, a post meta storage system, SEO
integration, and a brand new HTML-to-block parser that powers it all. On top of
that, Blockstudio is now completely free and open source.

Let's dive into everything that's new.

## Free and open source

I've been working on Blockstudio since 2020, shipping dozens of releases over
the years. The people who used it loved it, but finding market fit for a
commercial WordPress block framework was always a challenge.

What changed the equation is LLMs. AI coding assistants are now good enough to
write block code, but they need clean, file-based structures to work with.
WordPress block markup is messy: serialized HTML comments with embedded JSON
attributes, mixed with DOM structure. That's hard for humans and even harder for
LLMs to get right.

Blockstudio's file-first approach was always designed to keep things simple:
a `block.json` and a PHP template in a folder. No database entries, no React,
no build step. With v7, that philosophy goes even further. The HTML-to-block
parser lets you write plain HTML and have it converted into valid block markup
automatically. Everything stays in the filesystem. The only database writes are
automatic page syncs, and even those are driven by file templates.

Making Blockstudio open source is the natural next step. The more LLMs train on
Blockstudio code, the better they get at generating it. An open codebase,
open documentation, and a pre-built
[AI context file](/docs/ai) that any tool can consume: that's how you build the
best environment for AI-assisted WordPress development.

The full plugin is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/inline0/blockstudio) for anyone to use, fork, and
contribute to. No license keys, no paywalls, no feature gates.

## New features

### File-based pages

This is one of the biggest additions in 7.0. You can now define entire
WordPress pages as file templates that automatically sync to the database as
native block content.

Create a folder with a `page.json` and a template file:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "about",
  "title": "About Us",
  "slug": "about",
  "postStatus": "publish"
}
```

```php title="index.php"
<div class="about-page">
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our site.</p>
</div>
```

Blockstudio parses the HTML into WordPress blocks, creates the page in the
database, and keeps it in sync whenever the template file changes.

#### Keyed block merging

When templates sync, user edits would normally be overwritten. The `key`
attribute solves this by preserving user content across syncs:

```html title="index.php"
<h1 key="hero-title">Default Title</h1>
<p key="hero-description">Default description.</p>
```

Blocks with matching keys keep their user-edited content when the template
updates. Blocks without keys are replaced entirely.

#### Block bindings

As an alternative to keys, you can use WordPress core's
[Block Bindings API](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-bindings/)
to connect blocks directly to post meta. This is not a Blockstudio feature, it
is a native WordPress API. Blockstudio simply passes the `metadata` attribute
through to the generated block markup. Content lives in meta instead of block
markup, so template syncs never destroy user edits. The data is also queryable
via `WP_Query` and available through the REST API.

```html title="index.php"
<h1 metadata='{"bindings":{"content":{"source":"core/post-meta","args":{"key":"hero_title"}}}}'>
  Default Title
</h1>
```

Both approaches can be used in the same template.

#### Editing controls

Pages support `blockEditingMode` and `templateLock` to control what users can
modify:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "landing",
  "title": "Landing Page",
  "blockEditingMode": "contentOnly",
  "templateLock": "all"
}
```

This locks the page structure while still allowing users to edit text and
media. Individual elements can override the page-level setting with a
`blockEditingMode` attribute in the template.

#### Pinning to post IDs

Use `postId` to bind a page template to an existing WordPress post, preventing
duplicate pages and ensuring the template always updates the correct post:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "name": "home",
  "title": "Home",
  "postId": 2
}
```

For full details, see the [Pages documentation](/docs/pages).

### File-based patterns

Similar to pages, you can now define block patterns as file templates. Write
your pattern in HTML, and Blockstudio parses it into block markup and
registers it as a native WordPress block pattern. They appear in the block
inserter and can be placed anywhere by users.

```json title="pattern.json"
{
  "name": "hero-section",
  "title": "Hero Section",
  "categories": ["featured"],
  "keywords": ["hero", "banner"]
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<div class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Get started today.</p>
</div>
```

Unlike pages, patterns don't create database entries. They're registered in
memory on every page load. See the
[Patterns documentation](/docs/patterns).

### Storage

Fields can now store their values in post meta or site options, in addition to
block attributes. This is a big one:

```json title="block.json"
{
  "id": "subtitle",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Subtitle",
  "storage": {
    "type": "postMeta"
  }
}
```

With values in post meta, you can:

- Query posts by field values using `WP_Query` and `meta_query`
- Access field data through the REST API for headless setups
- Share data with other plugins like SEO tools and caching layers

You can also store values in the options table for global, site-wide settings:

```json title="block.json"
{
  "id": "phone",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Phone Number",
  "storage": {
    "type": "option",
    "optionKey": "company_phone"
  }
}
```

See the [Storage documentation](/docs/storage) for the full API.

### Custom fields

Reusable field definitions can now be shared across multiple blocks. Define a
set of fields once via the filesystem or a PHP filter, then reference them from
any block configuration. This eliminates repetition when multiple blocks share
the same field structure.

See the [Custom Fields documentation](/docs/attributes/custom-fields).

### Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind support has been completely rebuilt for v4. Instead of compiling
client-side via the CDN and saving to disk on post save (the v6 approach),
Blockstudio 7 compiles Tailwind server-side on every frontend request via
[TailwindPHP](https://github.com/dnnsjsk/tailwindphp). No Node.js, no CLI, no
build step required.

The compilation uses candidate-based caching: Blockstudio extracts all CSS class
names from the final HTML, sorts and hashes them together with your CSS config,
and checks for a cached file. Same classes produce the same cache hit, even when
the surrounding HTML changes (nonces, timestamps, dynamic content).

Configuration uses Tailwind v4's CSS-first syntax. Define custom themes and
utility classes directly in your `blockstudio.json` or via the
`blockstudio/tailwind/css` filter:

```php title="functions.php"
add_filter('blockstudio/tailwind/css', function ($css) {
  return $css . '
    @theme {
      --color-brand: #4f46e5;
    }

    @layer utilities {
      .container-narrow {
        max-width: 48rem;
        margin-inline: auto;
      }
    }
  ';
});
```

In the block editor, a bundled Tailwind CDN script provides live preview as you
type. The `classes` field type offers autocomplete for all Tailwind utilities.
The frontend always uses the server-compiled CSS, injected as an inline style
tag before `</head>`.

See the [Tailwind documentation](/docs/tailwind) for the full setup.

### SEO content analysis

Block content is now visible to Yoast SEO and Rank Math in the editor. This
means SEO plugins can properly analyze your Blockstudio block content for
keyword density, readability, and other metrics. No configuration needed.

## Enhancements and fixes

- **[AI context file](/docs/ai)**: the `blockstudio-llm.txt` has been rebuilt
  as a static file assembled from the full v7 documentation and deduplicated
  JSON schemas (~48k tokens), replacing the dynamic generation from v6
- **Code field popout**: the code field can now be opened in a separate window,
  with independent undo/redo and JavaScript syntax highlighting
- **Tailwind v4 server-side compilation**: see below
- **API version 3**: blocks now render correctly in the iframed editor,
  including the site editor and responsive previews
- **Dot notation for assets**: cleaner file naming convention for asset
  suffixes (`*.inline.css`, `*.editor.js`, `*.scoped.css`)
- Fixed `bs_render_block()` warning from `WP_Block_Supports` when using
  `useBlockProps`
- Fixed conditional fields not respecting default values on first load
- Fixed dollar signs being stripped from `<RichText />` content on the frontend
- Fixed `populate` feature to work with taxonomies registered by other plugins
- Fixed `optionsPopulate` null error in WPML contexts

## Under the hood

### Complete rewrite

This isn't a refactor or a cleanup. Every class has been rewritten from
scratch. The result is a cleaner, more modular codebase that's easier to
maintain and extend.

### HTML-to-block parser

A new HTML parser powers the pages and patterns systems. It converts standard
HTML templates into WordPress block markup, handling both container blocks
(like groups and columns) and leaf blocks (like paragraphs and headings). The
parser uses a trait-based renderer architecture, making it easy to extend with
support for additional block types via the `blockstudio/parser/renderers`
filter. You can also remap which block any HTML element maps to using the
`blockstudio/parser/element_mapping` filter:

```php title="functions.php"
add_filter( 'blockstudio/parser/renderers', function ( $renderers, $parser ) {
    $renderers['acme/hero'] = function ( $element, $attrs, $parser ) {
        $content = $parser->get_inner_html( $element );
        $html    = '<div class="acme-hero">' . $content . '</div>';

        return array(
            'blockName'    => 'acme/hero',
            'attrs'        => $attrs,
            'innerBlocks'  => array(),
            'innerHTML'    => $html,
            'innerContent' => array( $html ),
        );
    };

    return $renderers;
}, 10, 2 );
```

Once registered, you can use the block in any page or pattern template:

```html title="index.php"
<block name="acme/hero" background="/hero.jpg">
  <h1>Welcome to our site</h1>
</block>
```

### Modern PHP

Blockstudio 7 requires PHP 8.2+ and uses modern type declarations throughout.

## Breaking changes

As a major version update, 7.0 includes several breaking changes. Most have
backward-compatible fallbacks, but you should review them before upgrading. For
a complete migration guide, see the [v7 migration docs](/docs/migration/v7).

### Hook names now use snake_case

All PHP hooks have been renamed from camelCase to snake_case, matching WordPress
core conventions:

```php title="functions.php"
// Before (v6)
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/blockEditor/cssClasses', function() {
    return ['my-stylesheet'];
});

// After (v7)
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/block_editor/css_classes', function() {
    return ['my-stylesheet'];
});
```

The old camelCase names still work, but we recommend updating.

### Field switch defaults to off

The `switch` property now defaults to `false` instead of `true`. In v6, every
field had an invisible toggle on the left edge that was enabled by default. In
v7, switch is opt-in and uses a visible eye icon in the field label. If you
relied on the default switch behavior, add `"switch": true` to your field
definitions.

### Asset file naming uses dot notation

Asset suffixes now use dots instead of dashes (`style.inline.css` instead of
`style-inline.css`). The old dash notation still works, but dot notation is the
recommended convention going forward.

### npm import prefix

ES module imports now use `npm:` instead of `blockstudio/`:

```javascript title="script.js"
// Before (v6)
import confetti from "blockstudio/canvas-confetti@1.6.0";

// After (v7)
import confetti from "npm:canvas-confetti@1.6.0";
```

The `blockstudio/` prefix is still supported for backward compatibility.

### Removed features

- **Admin Area**: the settings page has been removed
- **License Key**: no longer needed (Blockstudio is now free and open source)
- **Code Editor**: the global code editor has been removed
- **Edit accordion**: the block inspector accordion has been removed
