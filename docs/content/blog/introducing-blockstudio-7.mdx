Blockstudio 7 is a complete rewrite of the WordPress block framework. Every line of code has been rebuilt from scratch with a focus on performance, developer experience, and full compliance with WordPress coding standards.

## Why a Rewrite?

Blockstudio started as a simple tool for building custom blocks without JavaScript. Over the years, it grew into a full framework with field types, templating engines, asset processing, and more. But the codebase carried years of incremental additions that made it harder to maintain and extend.

Version 7 is the answer: a clean-room rewrite that keeps everything developers love about Blockstudio while modernizing the foundation.

## What's New

### Zero JavaScript Required

Build fully custom blocks using only JSON configuration and PHP (or Twig, or Blade) templates. The editor UI, field rendering, and block registration are all handled automatically.

### 30+ Field Types

Text, textarea, number, range, toggle, select, radio, checkbox, color, date, time, code, image, gallery, file, link, rich text, repeater, group, message, separator, tab, and more. Each field type works in the editor and exposes its value in your template.

### File-Based Architecture

Blocks, pages, patterns, and extensions are all defined as files in your theme or plugin. Drop a `block.json` and a `template.php` into a folder and you have a working block.

### Asset Processing

Name your files with the right extension and Blockstudio handles the rest. SCSS compilation, ES module bundling, scoped styles, and automatic minification are all built in.

### Full Page Templates

Define entire WordPress pages as template files with native blocks. Pages sync automatically to the database and render with the block editor.

### Block Extensions

Add custom fields to any block (core, third-party, or your own) with a single JSON file. No PHP hooks, no JavaScript filters.

## Under the Hood

### WordPress Coding Standards

Every PHP file passes `phpcs` with zero exceptions. Consistent naming, proper documentation for public APIs, and strict type handling throughout.

### Modern PHP

Blockstudio 7 requires PHP 8.1+ and takes full advantage of enums, readonly properties, fibers, and named arguments.

### HTML Parser

The new HTML parser converts block templates into WordPress block markup at save time. This means your templates produce real, portable block content that works without the plugin installed.

## Getting Started

Install Blockstudio 7 and create your first block in minutes. Check out the [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. Upcoming releases will bring more field types, improved editor interactions, and deeper integration with WordPress site editing. Follow along on [GitHub](https://github.com/inline0/blockstudio) for the latest updates.
