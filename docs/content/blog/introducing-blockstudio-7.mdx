Blockstudio 7 is here. This is the biggest release in the history of the
project: a complete, ground-up rewrite of the entire codebase. Every class,
every hook, every line of code has been rebuilt from scratch with a focus on
modern PHP, WordPress coding standards, and long-term maintainability.

But this isn't just a refactor. Blockstudio 7 introduces major new features
like file-based pages and patterns, a post meta storage system, SEO
integration, and a brand new HTML-to-block parser that powers it all. On top of
that, Blockstudio is now completely free and open source.

Let's dive into everything that's new.

## Free and open source

After nearly five years as a commercial plugin, Blockstudio is now completely
free and open source. No license keys, no paywalls, no feature gates. The full
plugin is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/inline0/blockstudio) for
anyone to use, fork, and contribute to.

This was a decision we've been thinking about for a long time. We believe that
open source is the right model for developer tools, and we're excited to see
what the community builds with it.

## New features

### File-based pages

This is one of the biggest additions in 7.0. You can now define entire
WordPress pages as file templates that automatically sync to the database as
native block content.

Create a folder with a `page.json` and a template file:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "title": "About",
  "slug": "about",
  "status": "publish"
}
```

```php title="index.php"
<div class="about-page">
  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our site.</p>
</div>
```

Blockstudio parses the HTML into WordPress blocks, creates the page in the
database, and keeps it in sync whenever the template file changes. The result
is real, portable block content that works without the plugin installed.

#### Keyed block merging

When templates sync, user edits would normally be overwritten. The `key`
attribute solves this by preserving user content across syncs:

```html title="index.php"
<h1 key="hero-title">Default Title</h1>
<p key="hero-description">Default description.</p>
```

Blocks with matching keys keep their user-edited content when the template
updates. Blocks without keys are replaced entirely.

#### Editing controls

Pages support `blockEditingMode` and `templateLock` to control what users can
modify:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "title": "Landing Page",
  "slug": "landing",
  "blockEditingMode": "contentOnly",
  "templateLock": "all"
}
```

This locks the page structure while still allowing users to edit text and
media. Individual elements can override the page-level setting with a
`data-block-editing-mode` attribute in the template.

#### Pinning to post IDs

Use `postId` to bind a page template to an existing WordPress post, preventing
duplicate pages and ensuring the template always updates the correct post:

```json title="page.json"
{
  "title": "Home",
  "slug": "home",
  "postId": 2
}
```

For full details, see the [Pages documentation](/docs/pages).

### File-based patterns

Similar to pages, you can now define block patterns as file templates.
Patterns are registered in memory (no database entries) and appear in the
block inserter:

```json title="pattern.json"
{
  "title": "Hero Section",
  "categories": ["blockstudio"],
  "keywords": ["hero", "banner"]
}
```

```html title="index.php"
<div class="hero">
  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Get started today.</p>
</div>
```

Unlike pages, patterns don't sync to the database. They're purely
configuration-based and available for users to insert anywhere. See the
[Patterns documentation](/docs/patterns).

### Storage

Fields can now store their values in post meta or site options, in addition to
block attributes. This is a big one:

```json title="block.json"
{
  "id": "subtitle",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Subtitle",
  "storage": {
    "type": "meta"
  }
}
```

With values in post meta, you can:

- Query posts by field values using `WP_Query` and `meta_query`
- Access field data through the REST API for headless setups
- Share data with other plugins like SEO tools and caching layers

You can also store values in the options table for global, site-wide settings:

```json title="block.json"
{
  "id": "phone",
  "type": "text",
  "label": "Phone Number",
  "storage": {
    "type": "option",
    "key": "company_phone"
  }
}
```

See the [Storage documentation](/docs/storage) for the full API.

### Custom fields

Reusable field definitions can now be shared across multiple blocks. Define a
set of fields once via the filesystem or a PHP filter, then reference them from
any block configuration. This eliminates repetition when multiple blocks share
the same field structure.

See the [Custom Fields documentation](/docs/attributes/custom-fields).

### SEO content analysis

Block content is now visible to Yoast SEO and Rank Math in the editor. This
means SEO plugins can properly analyze your Blockstudio block content for
keyword density, readability, and other metrics. No configuration needed.

### Code field popout

The code field can now be opened in a separate window for a full-screen editing
experience. Combined with independent undo/redo (code changes no longer
interfere with the Gutenberg undo stack) and JavaScript syntax highlighting
that works without script tags, the code field is now significantly more
capable.

## Enhancements

- **Tailwind 4 support**: the integrated Tailwind CSS support has been updated
  to version 4
- **API version 3**: blocks now render correctly in the iframed editor,
  including the site editor and responsive previews
- **Dot notation for assets**: cleaner file naming convention for asset
  suffixes (`*.inline.css`, `*.editor.js`, `*.scoped.css`)
- Fixed `bs_render_block()` warning from `WP_Block_Supports` when using
  `useBlockProps`
- Fixed conditional fields not respecting default values on first load
- Fixed dollar signs being stripped from `<RichText />` content on the frontend
- Fixed `populate` feature to work with taxonomies registered by other plugins
- Fixed `optionsPopulate` null error in WPML contexts

## Under the hood

### Complete rewrite

This isn't a refactor or a cleanup. Every class has been rewritten from
scratch. The result is a cleaner, more modular codebase that's easier to
maintain and extend.

### 100% WordPress Coding Standards

Every PHP file in the codebase passes `phpcs` with zero exceptions. Consistent
naming, proper documentation for public APIs, and strict type handling
throughout.

### HTML-to-block parser

A new HTML parser powers the pages and patterns systems. It converts standard
HTML templates into WordPress block markup, handling both container blocks
(like groups and columns) and leaf blocks (like paragraphs and headings). The
parser uses a trait-based renderer architecture, making it easy to extend with
support for additional block types.

### Modern PHP

Blockstudio 7 requires PHP 8.2+ and takes full advantage of enums, readonly
properties, named arguments, and modern type declarations.

## Breaking changes

As a major version update, 7.0 includes several breaking changes. Most have
backward-compatible fallbacks, but you should review them before upgrading. For
a complete migration guide, see the [v7 migration docs](/docs/migration/v7).

### Hook names now use snake_case

All PHP hooks have been renamed from camelCase to snake_case, matching WordPress
core conventions:

```php title="functions.php"
// Before (v6)
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/blockEditor/cssClasses', function() {
    return ['my-stylesheet'];
});

// After (v7)
add_filter('blockstudio/settings/block_editor/css_classes', function() {
    return ['my-stylesheet'];
});
```

The old camelCase names still work, but we recommend updating.

### Field switch defaults to off

The `switch` property now defaults to `false` instead of `true`. In v6, every
field had an invisible toggle on the left edge that was enabled by default. In
v7, switch is opt-in and uses a visible eye icon in the field label. If you
relied on the default switch behavior, add `"switch": true` to your field
definitions.

### Asset file naming uses dot notation

Asset suffixes now use dots instead of dashes (`style.inline.css` instead of
`style-inline.css`). The old dash notation still works, but dot notation is the
recommended convention going forward.

### npm import prefix

ES module imports now use `npm:` instead of `blockstudio/`:

```javascript title="script.js"
// Before (v6)
import confetti from "blockstudio/canvas-confetti@1.6.0";

// After (v7)
import confetti from "npm:canvas-confetti@1.6.0";
```

The `blockstudio/` prefix is still supported for backward compatibility.

### Removed features

- **Admin Area**: the settings page has been removed
- **License Key**: no longer needed (Blockstudio is now free and open source)
- **Code Editor**: the global code editor has been removed
- **Edit accordion**: the block inspector accordion has been removed
